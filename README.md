# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (Stefan Mai)
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?
A: With a brute force approach, we have to try every possible option to get to an answer. With Naked Twins, there are constraints on certain boxes that allow us to prune significant parts of the search space. As an example, if we have 3 boxes with 3 identical possible values -- we don't have to iteratively try those 3 values anywhere else. We are using constraint propagation to trim unnecessary paths from the search space. With a significantly lessened search space, we can solve the problem faster (or tractably).

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?
For the diagonal sudoku problem, we have less possible options for each box. The diagonals add an additional constraint which lessens the search area. We use constraint propogation (together with the additional constraints imposed by the diagonals) to eliminate impossible boards.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solutions.py` - You'll fill this in as part of your solution.
* `solution_test.py` - Do not modify this. You can test your solution by running `python solution_test.py`.
* `PySudoku.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - Do not modify this. This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the ```assign_values``` function provided in solution.py

### Data

The data consists of a text file of diagonal sudokus for you to solve.
